  <h1>BAKING AS MY PASSION.</h1>

  <p><span class="first">My love for baking started in middle school when I made my first Oreo cheesecake cookie.</p>

  <p>It honestly didn't taste the best (it was way <em>tooooooo</em> sweet and it had my friends and I drinking<br> water after every bite), but despite that, it made me realize the beauty and fun of baking.</p>

  <p>Some of the reasons why I enjoy baking:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can eat!</li>
    <li>Ultimate destresser</li>
    <li>Room for creativity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But in my opinion, the best part of baking is that its meant to be shared with others. Nothing <br>beats the feeling than being able to share a meal with others.</p>
