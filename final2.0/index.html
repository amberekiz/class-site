      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div data-aos="fade">
        <p class="text2">Back when the Japanese invaded the <br>Philippines, Mama Pinang had just <br>recently given birth to her first son, Jose.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div data-aos="fade">
      <p class="text2">During that time, the Japanese were <br>ransacking their city, trying to get a hold<br> of any women that they can find for sexual<br> slavery. At the worst time possible, when<br> the Japanese arrived at their area, Jose
        <br>began crying non-stop, bringing attention
        <br>to Mama Pinang and their hiding place.

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div data-aos="fade">
      <p class="text2">Mama Pinang knew that if they were found, <br>they would be done for. Calm and collected, <br>Mama Pinang began to soothe Jose's tears <br>and bring him back to sleep. Mama Pinang<br> was dead set on making sure her and her <br>family would be safe.

        <div data-aos="fade">
      <p class="text2">By the time the Japanese got into their home, <br>it was extremely quiet, making them think <br>that the house was empty. The Japanese soon <br>left the home, with both Mama Pinang and Jose <br>safe and sound from the invaders.</p></div>

        <p class="text2">My cousins and I could never get enough<br> of this story when we were younger. Not only <br>because of how scary the whole situation was, <br>but also because of how brave Mama Pinang <br>was then. I can't imagine the amount
          of fear<br> she must've felt during that time, but the fact<br> that she was able to control it to make sure her <br>and her family was safe showed how much <br>courage Mama Pinang had. </p>

        <p class="text2">Together, they both worked hand in hand. <br>Everyday, they both had a set routine for <br>each other. Mama would assist Papa <br>with his office work, and Papa would help <br>in providing for both of them.</p>

        <p class="text2">My mom told me that when he died, <br>she had recently migrated to the States <br>from the Philippines. My mom kept<br> calling Mama Pinang, begging to come <br>home to be with her so Mama wouldn't be <br>alone in mourning
          for Papa. Despite my <br>mom's pleas, Mama Pinang was insistent<br> in saying that my mom shouldn't come <br>home. Mama was scared of the chance <br>that my mom might lose her green card.</p>
