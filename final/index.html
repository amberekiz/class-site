          <p class="white">Growing up, I was not the closest to my great-grandmother. I would visit her every Sunday for 13 years straight, but always felt that there was this barrier between us. Maybe it was because of our age gap, but I always felt
            unsure on how to approach her. Most of our interactions for the many years I have known her for ranged from paying my respects to having a meal several seats apart.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="white">A few months have gone by since she has passed away and it has given me the chance to reflect more on her. The more I think about her, the more I realize how much she has impacted my life and how important she is to my
            family. With this website, I want to cherish her memory and all that she has done for my mom, me, and so many others. I hope that Mama Pinang will continue to live in our hearts and that the mark she has made in this world will never be
            forgotten.</p>
